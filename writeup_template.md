## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/MC-8/SDC-P2-traffic-signs/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. The following image displays a sample of images present in the dataset. It can be noticed that the pictures, despite having the same resolution, have different quality. Some of them are easy (for a human) to identify while require a bit of eye-squeezing and imagination, due to lighting conditions, blur, etc.

The second image shows a normalized distribution of the classes in the three dataset. 
![alt text][image10]

It can be noted that training, validation and test datasets have very similar distributions, which is a positive characteristic as the training, validation and set will be done under similar conditions. However, the low-representation of some classes may lead to less precise results. Data augmentation will is in this report employed to increase the number of images in the training set, which should increase the accuracy of our neural network.


### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

When using images to train a neural network, there are at least a couple of consideration to do.
First, it is desirable to have quality images. Since this is not possible in the real world, it is more desirable to have a network that can recognize traffic signs even if the conditions are not so good. For examples, lighting conditions, blur caused by speed or fog,  and different viewing angles have all an significant impact on how well can we recognize a sign. 
Second, to facilitate the learning process, it may be helpful to reduce the complexity of the images in order for the network to discern important features and not be "distracted" by unnecessary features. For example, even if the color of traffic signs are distinctive of their tipology, is very well possible to correctly classify a sign even when the images is in greyscale.

In practice, converting images to greyscale achieves slight better accuracy. 
Here is an example of what the dataset looks like after applying a greyscale transformation.

[TODO IMAGE]

Due to the low amount of samples for some classes in the training set, I've decided to augment the dataset with random copies of images in the training dataset, but modified with some image processing algorithm. This way, an image with applied some digital filtering, is effectively a new image that can improve our network accuracy because it can add another "real-world" condition for our traffic sign.

Some image processing techniques (in addition to greyscale) that were considered (and are not limited to):
* Blurring
* Rotation
* Translation

Here is an example of the database after blur, rotation and translation are applied to random images in the dataset (some images may randomly be  processed by multiple algorithms).

[ TODO IMAGE ]

There are many other image processing techniques, such as warping and image flipping, that can be used but I did not. This is because I obtained good training results, and the implementation of multiple image processing algorithms are out of the scope of this project.

Additionally, I've experimented with histogram equalization, which is a technique that makes lighting and colors of the images more even across the dataset.
An example of an equalized dataset looks like this:

[TODO IMAGE]

This was to test my assumption that images that an even dataset (from lighting point of view) reduces the number of features that the network should detect (a dark sign is the same as a bright sign). In practice, even if there is a slight improvement, I have not found significant gain over the training performed with the greyscale dataset.

The last step before feeding images to our network is to normalize the image data. Each pixel per channel has normally a value in [0, 255] but in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the learning algorithm, it is good practice to normalize data using a floating point reprensetation that maps the integer [0, 255] range to a floating point range of [-1, 1]. 


#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x8 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x32 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x64 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 16x16x64 				|
| Fully connected		| outputs 256        							|
| Dropout				| Keep probability = 90%						|
| Fully connected		| outputs 128        							|
| Fully connected		| outputs 64        							|
| Classifier			| 43 classes        							|
 


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an ....

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of ?
* validation set accuracy of ? 
* test set accuracy of ?

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
* What were some problems with the initial architecture?
* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 

### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] 
![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8]

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ... 

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
#### 1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?
